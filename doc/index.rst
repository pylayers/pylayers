PyLayers : Python mobile Localization Electromagnetics Radio Simulator 
=======================================================================

Pylayers is a mobile radio propagation simulator. Its purpose is to help
designing localization and tracking algorithms for advanced communications
systems. It might be hopefully useful for illustrating various topics
on wireless communications and localization systems in higher
education.


Example 
=======

.. ipython::
    

      In [1]: from pylayers.antprop.coverage import *

      In [2]: C = Coverage()

      In [2]: C.tx = np.array((30,12))

      In [3]: C.cover()

      @savefig coverexampleo.png width=5in
      In [4]: C.showPower(polarization='o')
      
      @savefig coverexamplep.png width=5in
      In [4]: C.showPower(polarization='p')
..    In [1]: import pylayers.simul.simulem as sem

..    In [1]: S = sem.Simul()

..    @savefig example.png width=4in
..    In [1]: S.show()

Context
=======

PyLayers is being developed for research into radio localization exploiting impulse radio
signals as being defined in the IEEE 802.15.4a and 802.15.6 standards.
Pylayers could also evolved to help with studies related to channel characterization,
Wireless Sensor Network, MANET, radio cooperation and relaying techniques, 
physical layer security, WBAN applications, advanced home automation, aware environments ...

Pylayers is modular and designed to be easily extended, 
allowing it to evolve over the time as a tool for research and development in a wide range 
of communications and localization topics.

Documentation
=============

Pylayers is still in an early stage of its development. The code as well as the
documentation are in a beta version. The user manual section is embryonary and 
will be regularly populated with new examples of utilization. Pylayers is
better used in association with `ipython <http://ipython.org>`_

Third party packages 
====================

Pylayers is written in Python and is standing on the shoulders of the
following giant Python packages:

* numpy ( for algebra in multi dimensions )  
* scipy ( for scientific libraries )
* SimPy ( for discrete events simulation ) 
* matplotlib ( for the graphical outputs ) 
* networkx ( for graph description and algorithms ) 
* shapely ( for planar geometry )   
* ipython ( to rule them all ... ) 


Pylayers relies also on the interactive 3D viewing program `geomview <http://www.geomview.org>`_ tool for fast and simple interaction with 3D entities. 



Developpers
===========

Pylayers is driven by professor Bernard Uguen at `University of Rennes 1
<http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english>`_, `IETR laboratory <http://www.ietr.fr/>`_ and 
`ESIR school of engineering <http://esir.univ-rennes1.fr/>`_

Pylayers is currently developed at IETR  by Bernard Uguen, Nicolas Amiot, Mohamed
Laaraiedh and Meriem Mhedbhi, with the technical support of all the members from the
Research Team of the Propagation and Localization team of the `IETR
<http://www.ietr.fr>`_ lab.    

Among early pylayers contributors : Friedman Tchoffo Talom, Louis Marie Aubert, Roxana Burghelea, Yu Lei, Taguhi
Chaluyman, Stéphane Avrillon and Eric Plouhinec (Saint-Cyr CREC research center).


Download and Installation
=========================

The current version is tagged 0.1. 

Download the last release in your preferred format on github.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/pylayers/pylayers.git


We warmly encourage all new user to contribute new suggestions, algorithms, models and other improvements back to the project

**Just fork it !** on your github account and get in touch on the mailing list
if you get some interest or see practical applications.



Mailing List
============


There is a "http://groups.google.com/group/pylayers-users" mailing list for
users of Pylayers on which you can get help with using or extending the
software. New releases will also be announced on the mailing list.
