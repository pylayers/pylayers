How to goes from a simulnet to a Channel Impulse Response ? 
===========================================================

Generate a mobile simulation with simulnet
-------------------------------------------

Before any simulation it is necessary to fill the two main configuartion file
: `agent.ini` and `simulnet.ini` file in the  `/ini` directory
of the current project. 

agent.ini 
~~~~~~~~~

Below is an exemple of agent.ini file

configure simulnet.ini file

`[Save]` section 
----------------

+ `pyray` : use this option to generate outputs of the simulation compliant with pulsray  
+ `txt` : use this option to generate outputs of the simulation compliant with the WHERE2 DB

`[Layout]` section :
-------------------

+ `filename` option give the name ofd the file .str used for simulnet simulation

`[Network]` section 
-------------------

+ The network_update_time option give the sample rate of the output files.
    ( ! For a correct output GIVE THE SAME VALUE TO mecanic_update_time option in the [Mechanic] section)
+ The show option allow to display with matplotlib the simulation trace.( True or False)

`[Localization]` section 
------------------------

+ *localization* : boolean True/false for each mobile node (agent) compute their
position

+ *localization_update_time* : refresh time for localization

`[Simulation]` section 
-----------------------

+ The duration option set up the simulation duration

    configure agent.ini file

Before running the simulation it is necessary to select involved agents. This
is done in the /ini/agent.ini file from the project directory. 

In Section [used_agent]:
+ append the list option with the list of available agent in the following of
the file . Ex: list=['A1','A2','BS1','BS2']
In Section [agentidentifier]:

+ name name of node
+ ID identifier of the node
+ type option : select ag for agent ( mobile node) or ap for acces point
( static node)
+ roomId room where the node start the simulation
+ pos if roomID=-1 : position [x,y] where the node start the simulation
+ RAT option : select a list of rat name ( for now just keep only 'rat1') for
+ epwr list of emmitted power for each rat
+ refreshRSS refresh frequency of RSS measurement for the node
+ refreshTOA refresh frequency of TOA measurement for the node
+ condition not used for now


Running the simulation
-----------------------

.. python::

    >>> import pylayers.simul.simulnet as snet 
    >>> S = snet.Simul()
    >>> S.runsimul()

Illustration 1: terminal output after S.runsimul()

+ would you like to erase previous txt files ?
+ answer y to replace the previous .txt files ( compliant with the W2
database) by the ones from the current simulation


Once the simulation is finished, generated files can be find into

ProjectDirectory/netsave

Illustration 2: contents of ProjectDirectory/netsave


on the illusration 2

+ 1 and 2 are 2 mobile nodes. 1.ini and 2.ini contains trajectories compliant with pyray
+ 6 and 7 are 2 anchors . 6.ini and 7.ini contains a single position compliant with pyray
+ pyray.ini contains some information from the simulnetsimulation
+ all .txt are generated for the W2 database

Illustration 3: exemple of contents of 1.ini file


Compute and exploit pyray with the given simulnet files
-------------------------------------------------------

computation

.. python::

    >>> from pylayers.simul.exploit import *
    >>> E=Exploit()
    >>> E.compute()


E.compute runs the pyray simulation for

+ all anchors nodes (ap) to all mobile nodes (ag)
+ all mobile nodes (ag) a time 't' all mobile nodes (ag) at the same time 't'

This operation can take a while.....

Results
-------

The simulation generates .mat files in directory `ProjectDirectory/output/nodeid`

Illustration 4: Contents of ProjectDirectory/output/1 and 6

file name is build as follow : `defaultcir-tx_node_id-rx_node_id-pposition_id`

The position_id is related to the position number into
`ProjectDirectory/netsave/nodeid.ini`

Data exploitation
-----------------

either

.. python::

    >>> E.pltcir( nodeid1 , nodeid2, position_number)
or

.. python::

    >>> E.pltciri( nodeid1 , nodeid2)

pltciri allows to interact with the plot to display the desired CIR.

Invocate pltciri for 2 nodes for instance 1 and 6:

.. python::

    >>> E.pltciri(1,6)

The Layout and the nodes tracjectories are diplayed:

On the figure press 't' and then click a point of the node trajectory ( for instance the
red dot), to select a transmitter Tx

On the figure press 'x' and then click a point of the node trajectory ( for instance the
one of the blue) to select a receiver Rx
Press Enter to show the associated Channel impulse response (CIR)

+ Selected dot are marked with a black cross
