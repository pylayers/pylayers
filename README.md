## Developpers

Pylayers is driven by professor [Bernard Uguen](mailto:bernard.uguen@univ-rennes1.fr) at [University of Rennes 1](www.univ-rennes1.fr), [IETR](www.ietr.fr) laboratory and [ESIR school of engineering](esir.univ-rennes1.fr)

Pylayers is currently developed at IETR by [Bernard Uguen](mailto:bernard.uguen@univ-rennes1.fr), [Nicolas Amiot](mailto:nicolas.amiot@univ-rennes1.fr) and Mamadou Dialounde Balde, with the technical support of all the members from the Research Team of the Propagation and Localization team of the IETR (UMR CNRS 6164) lab.

Among early pylayers contributors : Friedman Tchoffo Talom, Louis Marie Aubert, Roxana Burghelea, Yu Lei, Taguhi Chaluyman, Stéphane Avrillon, Mohamed Laaraiedh, Meriem Mhedbhi and Eric Plouhinec (Saint-Cyr CREC research center).
