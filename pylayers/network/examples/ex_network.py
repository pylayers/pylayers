# ## Layout Creation
# 
# First we need to load a layout structure. 
# 
# A place where nodes from a network can move and communicate

# <codecell>

L=Layout('TA-Office.str')
L.build('str') # build 's'tructure, 't'opological and 'r'oom graphs
fig,ax=L.showG('',show=False)


# <markdowncell>

# ## Network Creation
# 
# Now we must instanciate a void Network. 
# 
# A Network will gather all radio acces technology RAT from all agents
# The Network class inherits from networkx 

# <codecell>

N=Network()

# <markdowncell>

# ## Agents Creation
# 
# Then we need to instanciate agents ( nodes ) into that layout.
# An agent is either a moving person or a static acces point which have one or more (RAT).
# 
# - For that tutorial we create 3 agents in room **0 ,3 and 5** respectively.
# - We suppose they communicate on the same and unique RAT : **'rat1'**
# - Obviously agent will evolve into the previously created network **N**.
#     

# <codecell>

Ag=[]
nb_agent = 3
room_init=[0,3,5]
for na in range(nb_agent):
    Ag.append(
              Agent(ID = na,
                    Layout = L,
                    net = N,
                    roomId = room_init[na],
                    RAT=['rat1']
                    )
              )

# <markdowncell>

# ## Connection Creation
# 
# Now we can create the Network. It means, we connect agents all together, according to their common RAT.

# <codecell>

N.create()


# show the Layout
fig2,ax2=L.showG('')
# show the network layer
N.show(fig = fig2, legend = True)

# <markdowncell>

# ## Nodes and edges

# <markdowncell>

# Because Network inherits of networkx, you can have information about nodes and edges as such

# <markdowncell>

# The node is a dictionnary whi containts the folowing keys :
# 
# * 'PN'  : Its Personnal Network ( described in the following)
# * 'RAT' : A list of RAT of which it belongs
# * 'p'   : Its true position
# * 'pe'  : Its estimated position if it has computed it by itself ( cf. location tutorial - IN CONSTRUCTION -)
# * 't'   : A time stamp
# * 'type': Its type ( 'ag' : for agent or 'ap' for access point )
# 
# example with node '0'

# <codecell>

N.node[0]

# <markdowncell>

# The edge is a dictionnary of dictionnary. 
# Each RAT is a key of the first dictionnary.
# Location dependent parameter (LDP) is the key of the second.
# 
# example with edge 0-1

# <codecell>

N.edge[0][1]

# <markdowncell>

# Obviously, LDPs values are void, because no location depend parameter have been still computed.

# <markdowncell>

# # Compute Location dependent parameters (LDPs)
# 
# LDPs are radio measurements bewteen agents. It could be either:
# 
# 1. Time of Arrival (**TOA**) 
# 2. Received Power (**Pr**)

# <markdowncell>

# ## EMS initialization
# 
# We first initialize the electromagnetic solver (EMS) for the given Network N. 
# We must give it a Layout strucuture, in order to be able to compute accurate LDP.
# 
# .. note:: it could have be made during the Network instantiation

# <codecell>

N.EMS=EMSolver(L)

# <markdowncell>

# ## Computation
# 
# The we compute *TOA* and *received power*  dependent parameters, and display for link 0-1

# <codecell>

for ldp in ['Pr','TOA']:
    N.compute_LDPs(N.nodes(),RAT='rat1',LDP=ldp)
