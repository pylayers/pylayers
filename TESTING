Introduction
------------

For testing PyLayers, various configuration files are required.
To guarantee, on each platform, that tests are relying 
on the same input file the $BASENAME is modified during testing 
in order to use the default files shipped with PyLayers.

PyLayers structure has a reserved directory $PYLAYERS/data which 
contains a template for project directory tree and the corresponding 
configuration examples or input files.
In order to run tests with those data files as input, we decorate the makefile
with a tempory switch of the $BASENAME directory, which indicates 
the current directory to used as default for input/output file operations.

Content of $PYLAYERS/run-tests file

#!/bin/bash 
export TMPVAR=$BASENAME
export BASENAME=$PYLAYERS/data
make test-code
export BASENAME=$TMPVAR


To test the code 
chmod +x $PYLAYERS/run-tests
$PYLAYERS/run-tests

Rules for introducing new tests
-------------------------------

A test files is in a tests directory and starts with test_
An example files is in a examples directory and starts with ex_

Each directory of $PYLAYERS/pylayers contains a tests and examples directory.

+ Examples files may have long loops, and figure output. 
+ Tests should be short execution time and as unitary as possible. 

Below is an inspiring example extracted from the numpy test suite

import numpy.polynomial.chebyshev as cheb

from numpy.testing import (
        TestCase, assert_almost_equal, assert_raises,
                assert_equal, assert_, run_module_suite)

class Testxxx(TestCase):
    def test_fonctionxxx(self)
        cheb.fonctionxxx
  
assert_equal(res, tgt)
assert_almost_equal(rse,tgt,err_msg=msg)
assert_raises(ValueError, cheb.chebval3d, x1, x2, x3[:2], self.c3d)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_module_suite()
