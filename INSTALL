The installation of matplotlib basemap requires installation of libraries GEOS
and PROJ4. The installation procedure is well described in

http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

For supporting the osm format PyLayers is relying on imposm. The installation 
of imposm is not straighforward it requires to install first Tokyo-Cabinet
and Google-Protobuf library. PyLayers can work without imposm you need to 
comment the only import to the module in pylayers/gis/osmparser.py.

Most of this dependencies are handled in the setup.py script.

python setup.py install

in your .bashrc add those 2 lines 

#export PYLAYERS=<path to the directory where pylayers is installed>
export PYLAYERS=~/pylayers
export BASENAME=~/plproject
